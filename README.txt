This program is designed to decode and display on a world map the data from Asterix files of category 21 and category 10. 
Asterix files are used in aviation surveillance and tracking systems, and contain detailed information about aircraft, 
including their position, speed, altitude, and more.

To use this program, you must first make sure you have the appropriate input files in Asterix format of category 21 or 10. 
Then, simply run the program and select the desired file. The program will automatically decode the data and display it on 
a world map, allowing you to visualize the position of aircraft in real time. Also you can calculate some interesting 
parameters of the efficiency of th MLAT.


Features:

Upon opening the program, you will see the main page with the time in the center, and a small menu on the left-hand side 
that takes you to the selected windows, whether it be the file uploader for .ast files, the map, or the information page.

Screenshot:

On the file uploader page, there is also automatic decoding of Asterix files of category 21 and 10. In addition to 
displaying all information in a table, there is a filter that can be applied to the table, whether by category, radar, 
aircraft identifier, and much more. It can also be exported to csv files.
Screenshot:

On the map page, there is simulation of the position of aircraft on a world map, where you can pause, fast forward, filter, 
and view information about each flight by hovering over the plane. There is also a detailed visualization of information 
about each aircraft, including its speed, altitude, and more. Aircraft detected by different systems may have more than 
one point, differentiating them with different colors for each radar.
